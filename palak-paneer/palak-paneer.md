Directions

**Making the paneer**

- In a large pot, pour roughly 1.5L of whole milk
- Stir, and let it come to a boil (it will start to foam)
- Take it off the heat, and add several tbsp of vinegar until you form curds and whey
- Strain the curds in a muslin cloth in a colander
- Rinse it through some cold water
- Hand squeeze the curds in the cloth to remove the liquids
- Form a pouch and place it under some weight
- Let sit over night or for a few hours (3hrs outside, 1hr in the fridge)
- When ready to use, cut into cubes, sized to your preference

**Blanching the spinach**

- In a large pot, add a little bit of water
- Take the spinach and rinse it through some water, leaving a bit of moisture on
- Blanche the spinach in the pot until it wilts
- When the spinach turns dark green (and starts stinking), put it in a colander
- Rinse it through some cold water and then hand squeeze out the water
- Put it in a blender and blend it into a fine paste

**Cooking the dish**

- In a pot, heat the oil
- Add the cumin seeds and wait until they start popping
- Add the onions and stir
- Add salt to help onions caramelize
- Once onions turn brown, add all the dry spices, including the ginger/garlic paste, and green chili
- Let onions cook.  If you used diced onions and want them finer, use a potato masher to puree them
- Add the tomatoes and let cook (medium-high heat)
- After a few minutes, add the yogurt and shredded coconut and stir
- Add salt to taste
- Add the spinach mixture into the pot and continue stirring on medium-low heat
- Add water as needed to get the mixture to your preferred consistency
- In a separate pan, add some oil and put the paneer cubes in
- Cook until lightly brown
- Pour the paneer cubes into the gravy and stir gently
- Let it simmer on low heat for a few more minutes
- Just minutes before serving, add some whipped cream and mix it in
- Add some cilantro to garnish and dinner is served!
