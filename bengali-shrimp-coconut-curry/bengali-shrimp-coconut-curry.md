Decided to start with seafood to get comfortable with cooking non-veg; a sweet, tangy, coconut curry.

- Difficulty: **Easy**
- Total time (prep and cook): **1.5hrs**
- Serves: **4 adults**

Ingredients
---

- 1lb - Frozen or fresh shrimp (21-30 grade, peeled and deveined)
- 14oz - Can of coconut milk
- 1.5x - Small red onions, finely chopped
- Fresh coriander (for garnish)
- 4 tbsp - Extra virgin olive oil (or just plain cooking oil)
- 1 tbsp - Ginger paste

Directions
---

- In a pot, heat the oil
- Add a bay leaf and stir
- Add the onions and stir on medium-high heat
- Add salt to help onions caramelize
- Once onions turn brown, add all the spices and continue stirring the mixture
- Add a bit of water (not too much as we'll be adding the coconut milk)
- After a few minutes, add the coconut milk and continue stirring on medium-high heat
- Add salt to taste and more green chili paste if you don't want the gravy to be too sweet
- In a bowl, marinate the shrimp with 1 tbsp of salt and 1 tbsp of turmeric (coat evenly).
- In a separate pan, add some oil
- Place the shrimp in the pan and cook for a few minutes until they curl up and become firm (5min or so on medium-high heat)
- Add the cooked shrimp and shredded coconut to the gravy
- Let it simmer on low heat for a few more minutes
- Add some cilantro to garnish and dinner is served!
