**Making the tomato sauce**

- In a colander, drain the liquid out of the canned tomatoes
- With bare hands, crush the tomatoes leaving about 1/4" chunks
- Add the tomatoes to the pot
- Continue stirring on high heat until everything cooks and softens up
- Leave it to simmer on low-heat, making sure to stir often

**Roasting the eggplant**

- Slice the eggplants into 1/3" thick slices
- Season the eggplant with salt
- In a bowl, add some milk (or crack the eggs and beat)
- In a bowl, pour in some breadcrumbs
- One at a time, soak an eggplant into the wash and then into breadcrumbs
- Lay the slices onto a baking sheet (covered with parchment paper)
- In a pre-heated 400F oven, place the baking sheets for 30-40min (make sure to flip 1/2 way)
- Leave it into the oven until ready to use

**The cheese filling**

**Combining it all**

- Pour in a layer of tomato sauce
- Grate some parmesan cheese over it all
- Lay out a single layer of eggplants
- Add some of the cheese filling on top
- Repeat the above 4-steps once more
- Add the final layer of tomato sauce
- Break little pieces of bocconcini or mozzarella cheese on top
- Add any final seasoning here (e.g. Italian seasoning)

- Take it out, let it cool, share with others and enjoy!
